•	Program Name:

o	cLiNUs

•	Description:

o	cLiNUs (Computational Landslide Initiation through Numerical Simulations) graphical user interface (GUI) is designed using the MATLAB (R2019a) App Designer and is developed to study the coupled hydromechanics of shallow unsaturated slopes prone to landslide hazards. It discretizes and solves the partial differential equations governing momentum and water mass balance for stratified deposits, thus allowing the versatile simulation of the soil response to hydrologic processes causing infiltration, moisture increase, deformation and failure. In addition, it is coupled with a novel vectorization strategy enabling the efficient computation of slope movements and safety factors at regional scale, thus allowing the mapping of model computations on digital terrain models. The GUI includes routines for simple parameter initialization, selection of hydro-mechanical constitutive laws, determination of boundary condition, and result visualization. The program also enables a straightforward use of data about soil heterogeneity, vegetation, swelling/shrinkage response and water runoff, thus ensuring a rich variety of analyses for educational and scientific purposes.
